then returns an array where the first element is the sum of those numbers, 
and the second element is a concatenated string that EXACTLY follows this 
example and uses the values that were input into the function:

/* Problem 2
Write a function called multiply() that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns an array where the first element is the product of those numbers, and the second element is a string that EXACTLY follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function:

Write a function called sumAndMultiplyThreeNumbers() that takes in three 
numbers as separate arguments and returns 
an array where the first element is the sum of those three numbers,

To do addition, use your sum() function, and to do multiplication, use your multiply() 
function that you've already created. You're going to have to be resourceful to figure out 
how to do this. However, you may continue to use the + operator for string concatenation.
